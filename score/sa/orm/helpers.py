    """
    Creates a class linking two given models and adds appropriate relationship
    properties to the classes.

    At its minimum, this function requires two classes *cls1* and *cls2* to be
    linked—where cls1 is assumed to be the owning part of the relation—and the
    name of the member to be added to the owning class:

    >>> UserGroup = create_relationship_class(User, Group, 'groups')

    By default, this will create a class called UserGroup, which looks like the
    following:

    >>> class UserGroup(Storable):
    ...     __score_sa_orm__: {
    ...         'inheritance': None
    ...     }
    ...     index = Column(Integer, nullable=False)
    ...     user_id = Column(IdType, nullable=False, ForeignKey('_user.id'))
    ...     user = relationship(Group, foreign_keys=[user_id])
    ...     group_id = Column(IdType, nullable=False, ForeignKey('_group.id'))
    ...     group = relationship(Group, foreign_keys=[group_id])

    You can choose the name of the new class by passing it as the *classname*
    argument, which also has an effect on the table name.

    It will also add a new member 'groups' to the User class, which is of type
    :class:`sqlalchemy.orm.properties.RelationshipProperty`.

    The parameter *sorted* decides whether the relationship is stored with a
    sorting 'index' column.

    It is possible to declare that the relationship does not accept
    *duplicates*, in which case the table will also have a
    :class:`UniqueConstraint <sqlalchemy.schema.UniqueConstraint>` on
    ``[user_id, group_id]``

    Providing a *backref* member, will also add a relationship property to the
    second class with the given name.
